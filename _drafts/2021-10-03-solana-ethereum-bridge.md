## Introduction

Back in April of 2021 Mina Foundation together with Ethereum Foundation announced the request for proposals for the design and implementation of a mechanism to verify and the Pickles SNARK on Ethereum: [https://minaprotocol.com/announcements/mina-foundation-and-ethereum-foundation-launch-joint-rfp](https://minaprotocol.com/announcements/mina-foundation-and-ethereum-foundation-launch-joint-rfp). Finally, after a rigorious selection process, =nil; Foundation's =nil; Crypto3 team [was awarded](https://twitter.com/minaprotocol/status/1443599014797135872?s=21) with an opportunity to facilitate such a project.

So this is the first within the series of blog posts covering some aspects of such a bridge implementation.

## So what? 
Since the whole Mina Protocol state (except archive nodes) can be and is packed within the single Pickles SNARK proof (remember - 22kb only) ([https://medium.com/minaprotocol/meet-pickles-snark-enabling-smart-contract-on-coda-protocol-7ede3b54c250](https://medium.com/minaprotocol/meet-pickles-snark-enabling-smart-contract-on-coda-protocol-7ede3b54c250)), this means it is possible to put the whole Mina Protocol state right onto Ethereum. Moreover, this means for the whole Mina Protocol state is in-EVM verifiable within a reasonable gas cost.

## Aaaand?
Full Mina Protocol state in-EVM verification means it is possible to bring everything what happens inside Mina to Ethereum, including financial applications, provable computations and many more. 

## Okay. How in particular?

Unfortunately it turned out that direct verification of Pickles SNARK on the 
EVM appears to be too costly. But! It seemed to be possible to design a system 
that may perform some preprocessing on the Pickles SNARK (e.g., by computing a 
STARK that verifies the Pickles SNARK which itself may be efficiently verified 
on the EVM).

So, this was exactly the approach taken.

## Auxiliary STARK-based proof.

The threshold cost of Mina state verification was set to be 5m gas. Direct
Pickles proof verification would've taken much more. The [RFP by Ethereum
Foundation and Mina Foundation](https://hackmd.io/u_2Ygx8XS5Ss1aObgOFjkA?view%23Definitions) 
suggested an approach which would result in submitting to EVM an additional 
STARK proof of a successful Pickles SNARK proof part verification, which could 
be considered as a valid in-EVM confirmation of everything what happened inside 
Mina. Such an approach - submitting proof of successfull proof verification - 
seemed to be fitting into 5m gas. Future was clear and bright.

But then, suddenly, even 5m gas turned out to be too expensive (thank you, 2021!).

## Let me guess - you decided to make it cheaper, right?

Exactly. STARK-based auxiliary proof verification turned out to be too expensive 
for the task. So we've started looking for different SNARKs to be used within 
the auxiliary proof.

After a brief discussion, Rank-1 Constraint System-based SNARKs were crossed
out as too costy ones as well. Even considering some of them were transparent
and very promising (e.g. Spartan), which would've brought a nice feature of absence 
of necessity to trust any set of actors to generate the proof for the Ethereum 
submittance. Imagine if you would be required to trust a group of people who did 
trusted setup so anyone capable of generating Mina state proof rely on them? 
Too much trust for that.

PLONK-based proof schemes are usually considered as ones with cheaper verification cost. 
But most of them (because of the most common commitment scheme used - Kate commitment 
scheme) trusted setup is required.

## So how to keep the bridge trustless along with keeping it cheap?

To figure out a custom SNARK for the auxiliary proof. That is how. 
Well, not a really custom one (let us not exaggerate things), but an experimental 
proof scheme.

In particular, RedShift-alike approach was selected (PLONK-based syntax over FRI
commitment scheme). FRI commitment scheme brings transparency to auxiliary SNARK 
proof and using PLONK-based syntax allows to reduce the resulting circuit.

This also resulted in much better costs: $3594270$ gas for a single verificaton.

## Sold. When?

The first milestone on the way is to introduce a very particular and well-optimized auxiliary proof circuit design to dot the i's and cross the t's (along with reducing the verification cost even more). This is expected to be done in Q4 2021 (Nov 2021 most probably). The production version is supposed to be launched 'till the end of Q1 2022.

Such a particular design will result in one more blog post with a descibtion. We will keep you updated!
